Related Terms:

For the related terms list, I actually provided a different website which has enough AI terms. Crawling that website, I appended all the technical words into my related terms array.

How the Crawler is Implemented?
-> For this assignment, I used 6 seed urls containing abundant links within them. Then I looped through each seed url, and grabbed all the <a href> links and put them in a sublist array. I named this list as finalLinkList. Since I haven�t used the recursive queue approach, I for looped through each seerUrl and pushed all the inclusive href tags separately. For this part I tried using python�s multiprocessing powers. Multiprocessor�s Pool functionality sends through 10 (in my case) urls each time and does all the calculations on it. When 10 urls are sent into the scrape function simultaneously, it grabs each url, counts the occurrence of the related terms and then prints and saves the file locally. If the related terms occurrence was more than 2, then I appended the url to my finalList. I grabbed the title, url, and the word counter and put them in my finalWebpagesList.txt. 
I used python file handling to write all the url details in the same txt page. I used the Urllib url retrieve command to download the webpages in my local directory.

The multiprocessing made this process significantly faster. I was able to webscrape all the webpages and download them locally within 10 minutes.
But there are some limitations to using multiprocessing. I couldn�t keep an index of the pages as they are received in 10s and also while writing the report, the statements often get jumbled as the multiprocessor does tries to save multiple lines at once. But the overall result is completely justified and all the results meet the requirements. I will try narrowing down my search parameters and shrinking my related terms list and also refining my seed urls.

Since the multiprocessor makes it almost impossible to index pages correctly, I created a second program called test_2.py to index all the links properly.
